# Chapter 17 - Wrapping Up the First Part of Your Learning Journey

In this chapter we looked at some of the complexities of data engineering in the real-world, and 
examined some examples of real-world data pipelines. We then look at some emerging trends to get 
an idea of what the future holds for data engineering, such as the increased adoption of a data
mesh approach, the reality of multi-cloud environments, the work that will need to be done to
migrate to open-table formats, how Generative AI may impact the field, and more.
