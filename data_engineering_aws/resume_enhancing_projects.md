# Resume-Enhancing Data Engineering Projects

# AWS Free Tier Eligible Projects
These projects can be implemented primarily using AWS Free Tier resources with careful planning and resource management.

## 1. Serverless Data Processing Pipeline
**Description:** Build a lightweight serverless pipeline for batch processing data files.

**Technologies (Free Tier Eligible):**
- AWS Lambda (1M free requests per month)

- AWS CloudFormation (free for infrastructure deployment)

**Impressive Elements:**
- Event-driven architecture
- Optimized Lambda functions to stay within free tier limits
- Intelligent throttling to avoid costs
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

**Free Tier Considerations:**
- Keep Lambda memory allocation low (128MB when possible)
- Implement cleanup routines to stay under S3 storage limits
- Schedule batch jobs to optimize free tier usage

## 2. Data Quality Testing Framework
**Description:** Create a framework to validate data quality for small to medium datasets.

**Technologies (Free Tier Eligible):**
- AWS Lambda for validation tests
- Amazon S3 for test data storage

- Amazon SNS (1M free publishes)
- AWS CloudWatch for monitoring

**Impressive Elements:**
- Schema validation
- Basic data quality rules engine
- Reporting and alerting system
- Test case management

**Free Tier Considerations:**
- Process smaller test datasets
- Implement timeouts to prevent Lambda execution overages
- Use compression for test data storage

## 3. Metadata Management System
**Description:** Build a simple metadata catalog for tracking data assets.

**Technologies (Free Tier Eligible):**
- Amazon DynamoDB (25GB free storage)
- AWS Lambda for API backend
- Amazon S3 for static frontend hosting
- AWS CloudFront (50GB free data transfer out)
- AWS IAM for access control

**Impressive Elements:**
- Simple search functionality
- Basic lineage tracking
- Tags and classification system
- Version tracking

**Free Tier Considerations:**
- Use on-demand capacity mode for DynamoDB
- Implement TTL for temporary data
- Optimize frontend assets for size

# Projects That Incur Costs Beyond Free Tier
These projects use AWS services that have limited or no free tier offerings and would likely incur costs.

## 4. Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline
**Description:** Build an end-to-end real-time data processing system that ingests, processes, and analyzes streaming data.

**Technologies (Cost Incurring):**
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (no free tier)
- Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose (no free tier)
- AWS Lambda for transformation (may exceed free tier)
- Amazon DynamoDB with provisioned capacity
- Amazon QuickSight (no free tier for production)

**Impressive Elements:**
- Handling of millions of events per hour
- Exactly-once processing semantics
- Anomaly detection using AWS SageMaker
- Disaster recovery and fault tolerance

**Cost Considerations:**
- Kinesis shard hours
- DynamoDB write capacity units
- QuickSight user licenses
- Data transfer costs

## 5. Data Mesh Implementation with AWS
**Description:** Create a decentralized data architecture following the data mesh paradigm, treating data as a product.

**Technologies (Cost Incurring):**
- AWS Lake Formation (costs for underlying resources)
- AWS Glue (no free tier for ETL jobs)
- Amazon Redshift (no free tier)
- Amazon API Gateway (may exceed free tier)
- AWS Organizations for multi-account setup

**Impressive Elements:**
- Self-service data infrastructure
- Automated data quality validation
- Federated governance model
- Data product documentation and discovery portal

**Cost Considerations:**
- Redshift cluster hours
- Glue DPU hours
- Data storage costs across services
- API Gateway request volume

## 6. ML Feature Store with Data Lineage
**Description:** Create a feature store for machine learning that includes comprehensive data lineage tracking.

**Technologies (Cost Incurring):**
- Amazon SageMaker Feature Store (no free tier)
- AWS Glue DataBrew (no free tier)
- Amazon Neptune for lineage graph storage (no free tier)
- AWS Step Functions for orchestration (may exceed free tier)
- Amazon ECS/EKS for custom processing

**Impressive Elements:**
- Feature versioning and reproducibility
- Automated feature drift detection
- Feature sharing across teams
- Integration with CI/CD for ML pipelines

**Cost Considerations:**
- SageMaker instance hours
- Neptune instance and storage costs
- Step Functions state transitions beyond free tier
- ECS/EKS cluster costs

## 7. Multi-Region Data Replication System
**Description:** Design and implement a system that replicates data across multiple AWS regions with minimal latency and strong consistency guarantees.

**Technologies (Cost Incurring):**
- Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables (additional cost)
- AWS Database Migration Service (no free tier)
- Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (data transfer costs)
- Amazon Route 53 (minimal free tier)
- AWS Transit Gateway for network connectivity

**Impressive Elements:**
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Region failover automation

**Cost Considerations:**
- Cross-region data transfer fees
- Replicated storage costs
- DMS instance hours
- Multiple region resource duplication

## Implementation Tips for Cost Management
- Start with lightweight prototypes using free tier resources
- Set up billing alarms and budgets
- Implement automatic resource termination when not in use
- Use Spot instances for development and testing
- Leverage Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Document cost optimization decisions alongside architecture
- Consider simulating certain expensive components locally during development

Remember that even with cost-incurring projects, you can demonstrate your architecture and planning skills through detailed documentation, diagrams, and limited proof-of-concept implementations. Many employers value the ability to design cost-efficient solutions just as much as technical implementation skills.
