# System Design Insights

## Cloud vs Local Infrastructure

### Core Infrastructure Components
- **Storage Solutions**: Cloud storage offers scalability and managed services, while local storage provides data sovereignty and lower latency.
- **Data Processing**: Cloud processing is scalable and managed but incurs data transfer costs and potential vendor lock-in. Local processing offers data sovereignty and lower latency but requires capital expenses and maintenance.

### Cost Optimization
- **Reserved Instances vs Spot Instances**: Significant cost savings can be achieved by using reserved or spot instances instead of on-demand instances.
- **Data Transfer Optimization**: Using services like Direct Connect or local caching can reduce data transfer costs.
- **Storage Lifecycle Policies**: Implementing lifecycle policies can move data to cheaper storage tiers, resulting in cost savings.
- **Automated Scaling**: Auto-scaling can optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

### Design Principles
- **When to Choose Cloud**: Ideal for variable workloads, global presence, and disaster recovery.
- **When to Choose Local**: Suitable for consistent workloads, data sovereignty, and compliance requirements.

### Performance Considerations
- **Latency**: Local networks offer the lowest latency, while cross-region cloud communication can introduce significant delays.
- **Bandwidth Costs**: Cloud egress costs can be high, making local networks more cost-effective for large data transfers.
