# Apache Kafka Basics for Beginners

## What Is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform:
- **Publish and subscribe** to streams of data (like transactions).
- **Store** messages for fault tolerance.
- **Process** data in real time.

## Important Concepts
1. **Broker**: A Kafka server that stores messages.
2. **Topic**: A category or feed name to which records are published.
3. **Producer**: An application that sends messages to a topic.
4. **Consumer**: An application that reads messages from a topic.
5. **Partition**: A way topics are split for scalability.
6. **Replication**: Duplicates data across brokers for reliability.

## Setup Steps
1. **Download and Extract**: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
```markdown
### Download and Install on Ubuntu

1. Update packages and install Java:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk
    ```
2. Download and extract Kafka:
    ```bash
    wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/3.8.1/kafka-3.8.1-src.tgz
    tar -xzf kafka-3.8.1-src.tgz
    cd kafka_<version>
    ```
```
2. **Start Zookeeper**:
    ```bash
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    ```
3. **Start Kafka Server**:
    ```bash
    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```
4. **Create a Topic**:
    ```bash
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic sample_topic \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 \
    --replication-factor 1
    ```
5. **Produce Messages**:
    ```bash
    bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic sample_topic \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    ```
6. **Consume Messages**:
    ```bash
    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic sample_topic \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning
    ```

## Integrating with the Project
- **Publish Anomaly Data** from a producer script.
- **Consume** that data with Spark or other services for real-time detection.
- **Scale** using multiple brokers and partitions for higher throughput.

## Further Explanation and Tutorial

### Brokers
- **Role**: Store, manage, and forward messages. Each broker can handle large volumes of data.
- **How to Use**: Ensure brokers can communicate (correct host/port), then start them so other components can connect. Monitor broker logs for system health.

### Topics
- **Role**: Logical grouping of messages. Each message belongs to exactly one topic.
- **How to Use**: Create, update, or delete topics using Kafka CLI tools, then ensure your producers and consumers work with the correct topic names.

### Producers
- **Role**: Send data to topics. Control partitioning and message formatting.
- **How to Use**: Configure producer properties (e.g., batch size, retries). Send data in real time or batch mode, using libraries in your preferred programming language.

### Consumers
- **Role**: Read messages from topics. Optionally balance load across multiple consumer instances.
- **How to Use**: Configure offsets and consumer groups. Ingest data from topics and process or store it.

### Partitions
- **Role**: Divide topics into segments for scalability. Each partition can be served by different brokers.
- **How to Use**: Assign partition counts when creating topics. Distribute workload among multiple consumers by pointing them to different partitions.

### Replication
- **Role**: Keep copies of data to guarantee availability. Minimizes data loss during broker failures.
- **How to Use**: Define replication factor when creating topics. Monitor leader and follower replicas to maintain fault tolerance.

## Tutorial Workflow
1. **Start All Services**: Launch Zookeeper and your brokers so the ecosystem is ready.
2. **Create Your Topics**: Reflect on scalability and replication needs before setting partition and replication counts.
3. **Publish Data**: Develop a producer script (e.g., Python or Java) that sends your anomaly events to Kafka.
4. **Consume Data**: Implement a consumer in your analytics tool (e.g., Spark or custom code) to process and detect anomalies in real time.
5. **Scale and Monitor**: Add brokers, tune partitions, and observe metrics for performance optimization.
