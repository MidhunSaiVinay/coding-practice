# Dot Product and Duality

The dot product is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that takes two vectors and produces a scalar value. 

## Definition
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements.

For vectors **v** and **w**, the dot product is:
- v · w = v₁w₁ + v₂w₂ + ... + vₙwₙ

## Geometric Interpretation
The dot product has important geometric properties:
- It equals |v||w|cos(θ), where θ is the angle between vectors
- Positive when vectors point in similar directions
- Zero when vectors are perpendicular
- Negative when vectors point in opposing directions

## Duality
Duality in linear algebra connects vectors and linear functions through the dot product:
- Every vector w defines a linear function fw(v) = v · w
- Every linear function can be represented as a dot product with some vector
- This duality helps translate between geometric and algebraic perspectives

This relationship between vectors and linear functions is a powerful tool in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
