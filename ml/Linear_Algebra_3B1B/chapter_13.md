# Change of basis
In linear algebra, changing the basis means looking at the same vector space from a different perspective. This concept is crucial for understanding how the same vector can be represented differently depending on our coordinate system.

## Key Concepts

1. **Basis Vectors**
    - Define how we measure and describe vectors in space
    - Different bases can describe the same vector differently
    - Standard basis: î and ĵ for 2D space

2. **Change of Basis Matrix**
    - Transforms coordinates from one basis to another
    - Columns represent new basis vectors in terms of old basis
    - Acts as a "translation dictionary" between coordinate systems

3. **Linear Transformations Under Different Bases**
    - Same transformation looks different in different bases
    - Matrix representation changes with basis change
    - Formula: B⁻¹AB (where B is change of basis matrix)

## Applications

- Computer Graphics: Different coordinate systems
- Quantum Mechanics: Different observation frames
- Engineering: Converting between measurement systems

## Important Notes

- The vector itself doesn't change, only its representation
- Change of basis preserves linear relationships
- Useful for simplifying complex transformations
