# Linear Algebra

## Introduction to Vectors

A vector is the fundamental building block of linear algebra. In essence, vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

### Vector Dimensions

- **2D Vector**: Contains two components (x, y)
- **3D Vector**: Contains three components (x, y, z)

Each component represents the distance to move along its respective axis:
- x-axis movement
- y-axis movement
- z-axis (in 3D)

### Vector Operations

#### Vector Addition
1. Place the second vector's tail at the first vector's head
2. The sum is a new vector from the first vector's tail to the second vector's head

#### Vector Multiplication (Scalar Multiplication)
- When a vector is multiplied by a number (scalar), all components are scaled by that value
- The multiplier is called a scalar because it scales the vector
