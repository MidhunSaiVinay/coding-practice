# three dimensional Linear transformation
## Definition

A linear transformation in three dimensions follows the same principles as 2D transformations but with an additional dimension. It's a function that takes a 3D vector as input and outputs another 3D vector while preserving:
- Vector addition
- Scalar multiplication

## Key Concepts

1. **Basis Vectors**
    - î = [1,0,0]
    - ĵ = [0,1,0]
    - k̂ = [0,0,1]

2. **Matrix Representation**
    - 3x3 matrix represents the transformation
    - Columns show where basis vectors land
    - [a b c]
      [d e f]
      [g h i]

## Common 3D Transformations

1. **Rotation**
    - Around x-axis
    - Around y-axis
    - Around z-axis

2. **Scaling**
    - Uniform scaling
    - Non-uniform scaling

3. **Shear**
    - Similar to 2D but with more possibilities

## Determinant
- Volume scaling factor
- Zero determinant means dimension collapse
