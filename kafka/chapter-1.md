## The real challenges of distributed systems

Key observations about distributed systems:

- No architectural paradigm is a 'silver bullet'
    - Similar to design patterns but broader and less prescriptive
    - Only partial solutions to common problems
    - Context matters significantly
    - Must understand limitations and implications

- Main challenge: Complexity shift
    - Moves from service implementation to inter-service fabric
    - Shifts from micro to macro level
    - Increases overall system complexity

- Why choose distributed architecture?
    - Enables problem domain compartmentalization
    - Allows decomposition into manageable parts
    - Facilitates parallel development by different teams
    - Supports gradual integration

- Organizational considerations:
    - Can be deliberate team organization around problems
    - May reflect Conway's Law (matching org structure)
    - Requires architectural oversight for conceptual integrity
    - Some organizations use democratic, organic decomposition
